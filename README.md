# **Buff Overlay**

This extremely lightweight addon was created for people to quickly and easily see defensive cooldowns active on other players so they can adjust their gameplay accordingly.


By default, all immunity and damage reduction abilities have been added.


Type `/bo` or `/buffoverlay` to open the options panel.

# **Multi Aura Bar Support**

You can have multiple (as many as you want) separate "bars" of auras on your frames, each with their own unique configuration.
