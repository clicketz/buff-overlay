# **Buff Overlay**

This extremely lightweight addon was created for people to quickly and easily see defensive cooldowns active on other players so they can adjust their gameplay accordingly.


By default, all immunity and damage reduction abilities have been added.


Type /bo or /buffoverlay to open the options panel.

# **Multi-AddOn Support**

- ElvUI
- VuhDo
- HealBot
- Grid2
- Shadowed Unit Frames

(Note: This list is not exhaustive. All addons supported by [LibGetFrame](https://github.com/mrbuds/LibGetFrame) should now work with BuffOverlay)

# **Full In-Game UI**

Now supports the ability to control your overlays completely through the in-game menu with persistent custom buffs that will stay through updates.
