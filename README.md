# **BuffOverlay**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NRKVqfA.png" alt="BuffOverlay" />

This extremely lightweight addon was created for people to quickly and easily see active auras on other players by overlaying that aura on that player's unitframe so you can adjust your gameplay accordingly. Despite its name, BuffOverlay can track both buffs and debuffs.

By default, all immunity and damage reduction abilities have been added.


Type `/bo` or `/buffoverlay` to open the options panel.

# **Multi Aura-Bar Support**

You can have multiple (as many as you want) separate "bars" of auras on your frames, each with their own unique configuration.
